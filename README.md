My Personal Repository

Skills :

  1. Machine Learning : Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
  2. Coding           : Python, Oracle SQL, Java, C, HTML/CSS
  3. Platforms        : Anaconda
 
Projects :

  1)Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Prediction -
     Machine Learning model which determines the country which best suits for Entrepreneurship by considering it's GEI SCORE (Score greater than 42 is considered to be best          country for entrepreneurship ecosystem ).
     Used ATM's users as a feature and trained the featured model with Classification algorithms and obtained efficient score by Random Forest Algorithm.

  2)Credit Card Fraud Detection - 
     Machine Learning model which detects the Fraud transaction. Exploratory Data Analysis on full data was performed, for unbalanced data Resampling was done and various            classification algorithm were used to train the model. 
     Evaluation is done by plotting ROC cure and Confusion Matrix for each algorithm.
